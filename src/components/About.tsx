          I’m a systems-driven builder who enjoys solving complex problems with clarity and structure.
          I combine technical skills with product and strategic thinking.
          I focus on long-term impact, not quick fixes.
          I value strong foundations, simplicity, and real-world usability.
          I’m driven by curiosity, ownership, and building things that last.
